# Dimensionality_Reduction_Technique

Write a colab to demonstrate various dimensionality reduction techniques discussed in the class using 

a) any image data set (i gave examples of faces and digits data sets colabs in slides in links / notes)

b) any tabular data set (i gave example of iris data set in slides with colab links)

You need to showcase 

i) PCA

ii) SVD

iii) LLE

iv) t-SNE

v) ISOMAP

vi) UMAP

 
**Conclusion**

UMAP is the better dimensionality reduction technique that can be opted for both tabular and image dataset as the clusters are seperated well when compared to rest of all the other dimenionality reduction techniques plots. Aso in all other plots could observe that the clusters are being overlapped which might not provide a better accuracy while building an ML model.
